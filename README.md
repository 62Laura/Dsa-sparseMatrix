# Sparse Matrix Operations

This project loads two sparse matrices, performs **addition**, **subtraction**, and **multiplication**, and saves the results.

## How to Run

Just run the `main.py` file. It automatically:
- Loads the input matrices from `sample_input/`
- Performs the operations
- Saves the results in `sample_results/`

## Output Files

- `sample_results/addition_result.txt`
- `sample_results/subtraction_result.txt`
- `sample_results/multiplication_result.txt`
